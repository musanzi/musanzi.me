  <p class="mb-3">
    I am a Christian, a tech enthusiast, and a software developer passionate about crafting impactful digital solutions.
    With 1 year of experience working with Angular and NestJS, I enjoy solving problems and simplifying complex
    processes to make technology more accessible.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    My journey into development began with a desire to empower businesses and communities through innovative tools.
    Today, I focus on building web applications that support entrepreneurs and foster innovation, particularly in
    French-speaking communities.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    When I'm not coding, I dedicate time to mentoring, helping others grow in their tech journeys, and exploring how
    technology can align with values of faith and service.
